<h2>Computer Science</h2>
<p>Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application</p>
<hr>

<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>Technology is the collection of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. </p>
<hr>

<h2>Computers</h2>
<p>A computer is a machine or device that performs processes, calculations and operations based on instructions provided by a software or hardware program. It is designed to execute applications and provides a variety of solutions by combining integrated hardware and software components.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Digital Divide</h2>
<p>A digital divide is any uneven distribution in the access to, use of, or impact of information and communication technologies between any number of distinct groups; these groups may be defined based on social, geographical, or geopolitical criteria, or otherwise.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Problem Solving</h2>
<p>Having good, strong problem solving skills can make a huge difference to your career.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Logical Thinking</h2>
<p>Logical thinking is the process in which one uses reasoning consistently to come to a conclusion. Problems or situations that involve logical thinking call for structure, for relationships between facts, and for chains of reasoning that “make sense.”</p>
<hr>

<h2>Creative Thinking</h2>
<p>A way of looking at problems or situations from a fresh perspective that suggests unorthodox solutions (which may look unsettling at first). Creative thinking can be stimulated both by an unstructured process such as brainstorming, and by a structured process such as lateral thinking.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
<p>Critical thinking means making reasoned judgments that are logical and well-thought out. It is a way of thinking in which you don't simply accept all arguments and conclusions you are exposed to but rather have an attitude involving questioning such arguments and conclusions.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Computational Thinking</h2>
<p>In education, computational thinking is a set of problem-solving methods that involve expressing problems and their solutions in ways that a computer could execute.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computing task.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Decomposition</h2>
<p>Decomposition in computer science, also known as factoring, is breaking a complex problem or system into parts that are easier to conceive, understand, program, and maintain.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Pattern Recognition</h2>
<p>Pattern recognition is the process of recognizing patterns by using machine learning algorithm. Pattern recognition can be defined as the classification of data based on knowledge already gained or on statistical information extracted from patterns and/or their representation.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Abstraction</h2>
<p>In software engineering and computer science, abstraction is: the process of removing physical, spatial, or temporal details or attributes in the study of objects or systems in order to focus attention </p>
<hr>

<h2>Algorithms</h2>
<p>In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a set of instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or perform a computation. Algorithms are unambiguous specifications for performing calculation, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.</p>
<hr>

<h2>PseudoCode</h2>
<p>Pseudocode is an informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm. It uses the structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Flow Charts </h2>
<p>A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents a workflow or process. A flowchart can also be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, a step-by-step approach to solving a task. The flowchart shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>Evaluation is the process of ensuring an algorithmic solution is a good one: that it is fit for purpose. Various properties of algorithms need to be evaluated including whether they are correct, are fast enough, are economic in the use of resources, are easy for people to use and promote an appropriate experience. Trade-offs need to be made as there is rarely a single ideal solution for all situations.</p>
<hr>

<h2> Debugging</h2>
<p>Debugging is the process of finding and resolving defects or problems within a computer program that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Sequence</h2>
<p>One of the three basic logic structures in computer programming. ... In a sequence structure, an action, or event, leads to the next ordered action in a predetermined order. The sequence can contain any number of actions, but no actions can be skipped in the sequence.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Selection</h2>
<p>Also called a decision, one of the three basic logic structures in computer programming. The other two logic structures are sequence and loop. In aselection structure, a question is asked, and depending on the answer, the program takes one of two courses of action, after which the program moves on to the next event.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Repetition</h2>
<p>Repetition means repeating a sequence of instructions a certain number of times, or until some specific result is achieved. In programming terms this means loops of all kinds, such as repeat, for, while, until etc. (e.g. move dog 1 step forward; repeat until dog is in kennel then stop). Self study resources.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Front-End Web Development</h2>
<p>Front-end web development is the practice of converting data to graphical interface for user to view and interact with data through digital interaction using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Developer Tools</h2>
<p>Developer tools (or "development tools" or short "DevTools") are programs that allow a developer to create, test and debug software. Current browsers provide integrated developer tools, which allow to inspect a website.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Website</h2>
<p>A location connected to the Internet that maintains one or more pages on the World Wide Web.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Webpage</h2>
<p>A hypertext document connected to the World Wide Web.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Elements</h2>
<p>An element may refer to any of the following: 1. When referring to Hypertext Markup Language, see our HTML element definition for further information.</p>
<hr>

<h2>DOM Tree</h2>
<p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming API for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Binary</h2>
<p>Relating to, composed of, or involving two things.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Hexadecimal</h2>
<p>Hexadecimal describes a base-16 number system. ... We show the equivalence of binary, decimal, and hexadecimal numbers in the table below. Hexadecimal is a convenient way to express binary numbers in modern computers in which a byte is almost always defined as containing eight binary digits.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Bits </h2>
<p>A bit (short for binary digit) is the smallest unit of data in a computer. A bit has a single binary value, either 0 or 1. ... Half a byte (four bits) is called a nibble. In some systems, the term octet is used for an eight-bit unit instead of byte.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Nibble</h2>
<p>In computers and digital technology, a nibble (pronounced NIHB-uhl; sometimes spelled nybble) is four binary digits or half of an eight-bit byte. A nibble can be conveniently represented by one hexadecimal digit. ... A signal may be encoded in quadbits rather than one bit at a time.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Byte</h2>
<p> A group of binary digits or bits (usually eight) operated on as a unit.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Kilo</h2>
<p>Kilo is a decimal unit prefix in the metric system denoting multiplication by one thousand (103). It is used in the International System of Units where it has the unit symbol k, in lower case. The prefix kilo is derived from the Greek word χίλιοι (chilioi), meaning "thousand".</p>
<hr>

<h2>Mega</h2>
<p>Mega- ... Mega is a unit prefix in metric systems of units denoting a factor of one million (106 or 1000000). It has the unit symbol M. It was confirmed for use in the International System of Units (SI) in 1960. Mega comes from Ancient Greek: μέγας, romanized: megas, lit. 'great'.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Giga</h2>
<p>a unit of information equal to one billion (109) or, strictly, 230 bytes.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Tera</h2>
<p>Tera- ... It has the symbol T. Tera is derived from Greek word τέρας teras, meaning "monster". The unit prefix was confirmed for use in the International System of Units (SI) in 1960. Examples of its use: terahertz radiation: electromagnetic waves within the band of frequencies from 0.3 to 3 THz.</p>
<hr>

<h2>AND && (BASH)</h2>
<p>&& is the "AND" control operator. From bash man: The control operators && and. ... The return status of AND and OR lists is the exit status of the last command executed in the list.</p>
<hr>

<h2>OR || (BASH)</h2>
<p>Bash. Bash, though typically not capitalized, is an acronym for "Bourne-Again Shell" and is named after Stephen Bourne, the creator of the Unix shell "sh." It is a command language interpreter derived from sh that can execute commands entered at a command prompt and process text file input.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Function (BASH)</h2>
<p>Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Variable (BASH)</h2>
<p>A shell variable is a variable that is available only to the current shell. In contrast, an environment variable is available system wide and can be used by other applications on the system. ... It processes the commands entered on the command line or read from a shell script file.</p>
<hr>

<h2>String (BASH)</h2>
<p>On Unix-like operating systems, eval is a builtin command of the Bash shell. It concatenates its arguments into a single string, joining the arguments with spaces, then executes that string as a bash command.</p>
<hr>
